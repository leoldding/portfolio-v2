            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm a firm believer in continually learning new things. Even after graduating from NYU with a degree in Computer Science and Data Science, I've picked up cloud technology certifications and continue to build projects to hone my typing skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I'm hitting the gym, watching motorsports, solving Rubik's Cubes, or cleaning up a (virtual) minefield.
            </p>
